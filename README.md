# cancer-patient-outcome-analysis
Data analysis and modeling of cancer patient outcomes using Python
# Problem Definition
Cancer remains a leading cause of death globally. Timely and accurate insights into the factors influencing patient outcomes can play a critical role in enhancing treatment plans and improving survival rates. Understanding which variables affect progression, remission, or mortality can also assist in developing targeted healthcare interventions.
# Objective
To analyze a dataset of cancer patients using Python, with the goal of:
    Identifying patterns and correlations between variables such as demographics, treatment types, and outcomes.
    Predicting patient outcomes based on clinical and demographic features.
    Uncovering risk factors associated with cancer progression and mortality.
# Tools & Libraries Used
    Python
    Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation
    Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly – Visualization
    Scikit-learn – Modeling and prediction
    Statsmodels – Statistical analysis
# Steps Undertaken
    Data Collection & Loading
        Imported a structured cancer dataset.
        Loaded data using Pandas and inspected for structure, completeness, and basic summary statistics.
# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  Handled missing values through imputation or removal.
  Encoded categorical variables using one-hot or label encoding.
  Normalized or standardized numerical features for modeling.
